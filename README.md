# FrostOptima v1.0

Retail profit optimization tool that compares margin-focused vs. volume-focused product strategies.

## The Problem

Retail managers often prioritize high-margin products for premium placement, but high-volume products with lower margins frequently generate more total profit. This tool quantifies the tradeoff with data for any retail category.

## Features

- **Universal Product Analysis**: Works for any product category (frozen, produce, electronics, etc.)
- **Strategy Comparison**: Compare HIGH MARGIN vs. HIGH VOLUME approaches side-by-side
- **Data-Driven Recommendations**: Shows which strategy generates more total profit
- **Flexible Input**: Analyze any products with cost, sell price, and demand data

## Example Use Case

Demonstrated with Publix frozen food endcap (3-door ONRZH unit), but applicable to any retail product category or display configuration.

## Technical Implementation

Built with Google AI Studio Code Assistant using:
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Real-time calculation engine
- Responsive design
- Based on 20+ years retail operations experience

## Background

After 20+ years in grocery retail, I identified a recurring pattern across all departments: management consistently overvalues margin percentage while undervaluing unit velocity. This tool proves optimal strategies with data instead of intuition.

## Future Enhancements (v2.0)

- Visual display configurations (freezer, shelf, endcap)
- Demand forecasting integration
- Space constraint modeling
- Category-specific optimization rules
- Multi-week simulation
